                    <p class="lead">Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is famously known as the "Pink City" for the distinctive pink hue of its buildings. Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the city was meticulously planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, making it one of the first planned cities of India.</p>
                    <p>Its strategic design, vibrant culture, and magnificent architecture quickly established it as a prominent center of art and commerce. The city's foundation marked a new era in Rajputana history, moving away from the more rugged terrain of Amber to a more expansive and aesthetically pleasing location.</p>

                    <p>The city earned its "Pink City" moniker in 1876 when Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II had the entire city painted pink to welcome Prince Albert and Queen Victoria. Pink, traditionally a color of hospitality, has since remained the dominant color, giving Jaipur its unique identity and charm.</p>
                    <p>This tradition continues to this day, with strict regulations ensuring new buildings in the old city conform to the iconic pink sandstone color, preserving its timeless beauty. Every street, every building tells a story of royalty, valor, and artistic grandeur.</p>
